# Password Generator

## Description

This project is an application that generates random passwords for a user based on certain criteria.

- Clicking the "Generate Password" button triggers a series of prompts, presenting the user with password criteria options.
- Upon being prompted for the desired password length, the user can input a value between 8 and 128 characters.
- The application validates the input to ensure it meets the criteria, and if the user's input is outside this range, an alert informs them to retry.
- The user proceeds to confirm their choices regarding the inclusion of lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters in the password.
- Once the password is generated, it is displayed on the page within a text box for the user's convenience.
